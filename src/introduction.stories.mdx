# Design System Component Library Team Ost

üêº

Our goal for the Design System Block: Create our Frontend Components (React) in Storybook and release them as a npm package.
In the Second Block, Your Components Will Become an App with Next.js
And Finally You'll Learn About Security and How to Run This Thing in the Cloud


## How to use in a Next.js project

1. Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project. You could find additional information [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).
2. Install Component Library

    ```
    npm install @smartive-education/design-system-component-library-team-ost
    ```
3. Make your app using the tailwind presets of our design system. You have to add the following code snippet to the tailwind.config.js.

    ```
    presets: [
        require('@smartive-education/design-system-component-library-team-ost/tailwind-config')
    ],
    ```
4. Make the Component Library using the Tailwind CSS of your App. You have to add the following code snippet to the tailwind.config.js.

    ```
    content: [
        ...
        "./node_modules/@smartive-education/design-system-component-library-team-ost/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
    ],
    ```
5. Add Google Font "Poppins", Medium, Semibold and Bold to your App. So you have the advantage of the built-in font optimization feature. (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)
6. Start using the components :-D
