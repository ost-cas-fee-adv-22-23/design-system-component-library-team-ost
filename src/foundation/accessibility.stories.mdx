# Accessibility

As an open platform for people, we want to offer the best possible experience for everyone. That's why we paid a lot of attention to accessibility when implementing the components. 

Some components were implemented with [headlessUI](https://headlessui.com/), which is optimized for accessible web.

For A11y validation of our components we use an addon for Storybook [storybook-addon-a11y](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y).

## Why is it important to us?
- Accessible design means better design, for everyone.
- We care about creating a product that can be used by people from all walks of life, accessibility is a critical aspect of that.
- It's a best practice for designing and building software.
- It ensures legal compliance.

## Best practices
We followed the best practices of [gusto](https://workbench.gusto.com) and have listed them here.

The [A11YProject](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) provides also a good checklist.

### Color
- Don't use color as the only visual means of conveying information.
- Avoid using red and green together.
- Use color to highlight or complement what's already visible.

### Contrast
- Many users with low vision still read content on their devices, so providing good contrast is essential for all important information.
- Check contrast for body copy, links, buttons, headers, icons, images with functional text.
- Elements that don't need to pass contrast: logos, disabled states(inactive menu or buttons).

### Content design
- Use plain language that simplifies complexity wherever possible.
- Use bullet points, headings, and lean on structured content where possible.
- Give users enough time to read and use the content—avoid content that disappears or is animated.
- Write descriptive labels for headers, buttons, links, and input fields.
- Avoid obscure, out of context copy such as “Learn more”.
- On buttons and links, use a verb + noun format (eg: Save form ) wherever possible so people know what action they're taking—where this isn't possible use an aria-label on the link target with the verb + noun format. Screen readers may navigate through all the links of the page directly, so if link text does not have enough context on its own it may be inaccessible.

### Form fields
- Place labels or instructions outside of form fields.
- Don't use placeholder text as a label.

### Media
- Think about it as supporting all senses when possible.
- Provide text alternatives for media(images or video ).
- Video transcription or captioning.
- Allow for viewing at multiple speeds, or the ability to pause or turn off.
- If it's purely decorative, no description is necessary.

### Images
- Add alt text descriptions to describe the content.
- Never add “picture of” to thealt text description.

### Keyboard
- Remember that our big desk power users also benefit from keyboard use !
- When possible, make everything operable from a keyboard.
- Follow WAI-ARIA authoring guides or use design systems components to ensure standard keyboard interactions
- Provide visual focus indication for keyboard focus.
- Make sure keyboard focus order matches the order of the layout visually.
- Never use positive tabindex. Instead, order your HTML in accordance with tab navigation. If tab order does not match visual order, use CSS and not HTML tabindex. - If content automatically hides after a timeout, make sure to provide users enough time to tab to the relevant content or ensure that there is an alternative way to perform the same task which is persistent - Avoid programmatically moving focus, except in very specific situations.
- Dialogs are an exception where focus must be trapped and managed to maintain context.
